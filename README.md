# Build and environment needed

### Software preparation

 To build our app you will need to install JDK 1.8 (can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)) and [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) installed on your computer. This app can be build on windows and linux without issue (just remove sudo before all commands for windows).

### Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/retrobox/android`
2. Install Fastlane with ```sudo gem install fastlane -NV ```
3. Add your env variables (see bottom)
4. Add the project to Android Studio

 ### Environment variables
 Please add the files to your project (see in the exemple file to know what to do)

 - .\\.env # Google Cloud Service account key & others things
 - .\keystore.properties # Private keys to sign app with the .jks certificate
 - .\api.key_gpc.json # Private api key for Google Play Console access
 - .\app\google-services.json # Firebase api key ([doc](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup))
 - .\app\keystore_private.jks # Private android studio certificate ([doc](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing))

### Build

⚠️ Be aware, here are several types of build:  

- devDebug # Debug the dev version (log everything)
- devRelease # (we do not use this build)
- proDebug # Debug the release version (log everything)
- proRelease # The version who will be pushed to Google Play Store

Examples :  
- build_flavor -> debug or release
- build_type -> pro or dev

After adding all your env files, run :

- ```sudo bundle exec fastlane supply init```

This will synchronize with the GPC, all metadatas.

Next, just choose to the left tab "Build variants" the type of version you want to build in Android Sutdio, then run build.  
You can also use these commands :

- ```bundle exec fastlane assemble_build build_flavor:"YourBuildFlavor" build_type:"YourBuildType"```

- ```sudo ./gradlew build``` # This is a hard build, this will work, but we do not recommend to use it.

## Autonomous deploy explanation

### Fastlane ```.\fastlane```

We use Fastlane because is the easiest way to do CI/CD, this is a powerfull tool (and free !).

See more in `.\fastlane\README.md`.
